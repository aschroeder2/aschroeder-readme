## Personal

### Family
* My immediate family consists of my husband Zach and our two dogs Monti and Sady
* I have extended family scattered all over the USA, and I love to take long weekends to visit them

### Hobbies
* Getting outside, preferably away from other people
  * Hiking
  * Backpacking (finished all 10 NZ Great Walks!)
  * Camping
  * Kayaking
* Avid reader - especially classics and sifi/fantasy
* Travel
  * My next really big trip will be Kilimanjaro 
  * In the mean time I want to see Redwoods National Park, Yellowstone, East Coast USA, Iceland, Norway, and England

### Personal aspirations
* Learn to play an instrument proficiently (I've dabbled in quite a few, but never gotten really good)
* Travel to Antarctica - my last continent! 
* Become a snowbird - We want a house in Wisconsin and somewhere by the ocean for winter, probably Florida 


## Professional

### Things I value and believe
* Bring the fun
* Close collaboration with teammates
* Delight in feedback
  * Giving and receiving
  * No matter which end you are on, its a growth opportunity
* Always know why you do something
* Independence
  * Avoid reliance on others to do things
  * Answer your own questions - sometimes this gets me in trouble
* Share knowledge - no single points of failure
* Ambiguity is an opportunity not a blocker
* Know everything about your company
* Standards and style guides - love things that are consistent and pretty

### Learning Style
* Doing - I want to dive into practical tasks and exhaust all my resources to answer questions before asking someone
* Peer conversations and/or feedback - I learn from all the smart people around me
* Teaching - I have a love hate relationship with running training sessions (formal and informal), but I always learn a lot!

### Favorite Types of Projects
* Abstract, ambiguous asks
* Improvement initiatives - I love the analysis
* Process design - I know, people over process, but man I love figuring out and running a good process

### Professional Aspirations
* I am historically bad at setting goals...
* Master Bullhorn's application ecosystem
* Contribute to an open source project
