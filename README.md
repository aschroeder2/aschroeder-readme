### Family
* My immediate family consists of my husband Zach and our two dogs Monti and Sady
* Before too long I will extend our family with the addition of a hedgehog (life long dream!)
* I have extended family scattered all over the USA, and I love to take long weekends to visit them

### Hobbies
* Getting outside, preferably away from other people
  * Hiking
  * Backpacking (finished all 10 NZ Great Walks!)
  * Camping
  * Kayaking
* Avid reader - especially classics and sifi/fantasy
* Travel
  * My next really big trip will be Kilimanjaro 
  * In the mean time I want to see Redwoods National Park, Yellowstone, Iceland, Norway, and England

### Personal aspirations
* Learn to play an instrument proficiently (I've dabbled in quite a few, but never gotten really good)
* Travel to Antarctica - my last continent! 
  * Also has some family significance, led to my family's tie to New Zealand
* Become a snowbird - We want a house in Wisconsin and somewhere warm for the winter, probably Florida 



## Professional

### Professional Values/Beliefs
* Close collaboration with teams
* Don't design in a silo
* Bring the fun
* Delight in feedback - giving and receiving
* Be independent
  * if there is something I need, I want to learn to do it myself, not rely on other people or teams to do things for me
* Answer my own questions
* Share knowledge - avoid being a single point of failure
* Ambiguity is an opportunity not a blocker
* Learn everything about the company
* Always know why you do something

### Learning Style
* Doing - I want to dive into practical tasks
* Teaching - I have a love hate relationship with running training sessions (formal and informal), but I always learn a lot!
* Things I am not very good about...
  * Online training - I use it to get a quick baseline, but longstanding classes don't work very well for me without challenges to work on
  * Professional reading
  * In person group sessions, I'm shy, I don't like to ask questions in a group session

### Favorite Types of Projects
* Abstract, ambiguous asks
* Process design - I know, people over process, but man I love running a good process
* Improvement initiatives - I love the analysis

### Professional Aspirations
* I am historically bad at setting goals...
* Master Bullhorn's application ecosystem
*
